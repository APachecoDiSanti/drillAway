First LDJAM game!
Learned lots of lessons and made something playable!


## HOW TO PLAY
You're trapped in a cave that's collapsing! Your only chance to escape the debris from the right is to _go deeper_ inside the cave and _DRILL AWAY!_
There's no way to win, sadly. Try to get the highest score possible by drilling blocks!

Move towards blocks to drill them.
Rocky blocks are harder to drill.
ROCK blocks are too hard to drill! You must find a way around them.
